# Grant Proposal for Funding of Elacestrant

This grant proposal was drafted by a small group for BIOST 524: Design of Medical Studies. The proposal advocated for a phase 2b study of Elacestrant in breast cancer patients compared to standard of care.

# Contents

This project consists of the grant proposal, which is based off of an existing drug called Elacestrant. The proposal was defended by the project group to two UW professors and a small group of peers. 

# Lessons Learned

This project allowed me to understand clinical trials more fully â€“ writing the grant proposal meant pre-specifying every aspect of recruitment, analysis, the budget, etc. I was also not familiar with the drug or the patient population before starting this project, so I worked alongside those in my group with clinical backgrounds to better understanding these critical aspects of the project. I also gained experience with sample size calculations and pre-specification of statistical methods for survival analysis.
