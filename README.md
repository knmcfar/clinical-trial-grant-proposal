# Grant Proposal for Funding of Elacestrant

This grant proposal was drafted by a small group for BIOST 524: Design of Medical Studies. The proposal advocated for a phase 2b study of Elacestrant in breast cancer patients compared to standard of care and was defended by the project group to two UW professors and a small group of peers. 

# Contents

This project consists of the grant proposal, which is based off of an existing drug called Elacestrant.

# Lessons Learned

This project allowed me to understand clinical trials more fully â€“ writing the grant proposal meant pre-specifying every aspect of recruitment, analysis, the budget, and so on. I was also not familiar with the drug or the patient population before starting this project, so I worked alongside those in my group with clinical backgrounds to better understanding these critical aspects of the project. I also gained experience with sample size calculations and pre-specification of statistical methods for survival analysis.
